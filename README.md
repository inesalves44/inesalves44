### About Me :raising_hand_woman:
My name is InÃªs, I am a Chemical Enginner :woman_scientist: turned programmer! :woman_technologist:

I worked for 4 years in quality control and management, and now I am trying to change my career path in 42 Porto, one of the top programming schools in the world! In the meantime I got accepted in a program called Upskill that helps people begin a career in IT. 

So, besides learning C and C++ in 42 I am also learning C#, HTML, CSS, Angular and Power platform. The objective for the end of the course is to be microsoft certified in Power Platform!

At the same time I am, on my own, learning more about the beautiful world of data and creating fun projects to test what I am learning!!

So, here I am, trying to understand and learn about all the aspects in a Data cycle. From Data Analyst to Data Engineering!
But I do not limit myself so any type of programming challenge is welcomed!

When I am not programming I am usually reading :books: or watching :tv: or even better exploring the North of Portugal!
