### About Me :raising_hand_woman:
My name is InÃªs, I am a Chemical Enginner :woman_scientist: turned programmer! :woman_technologist:

I worked for 4 years in quality control and management, and now I am trying to change my career path in 42 Porto, one of the top programming schools in the world!

Rigth now I am learning the ins and outs of the C programming language in 42.

At the same time I am, on my own, learning more about the beautiful world of data!!

</div>

Here I am trying to understand and learn about all the aspects in a Data cycle. From Data Analyst to Data Engineering!
But I do not limit myself so any type of programming challenge is welcomed!

When I am not programming I am usually reading :books: or watching :tv: or even better exploring the North of Portugal!
